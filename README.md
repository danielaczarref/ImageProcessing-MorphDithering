# Image Processing

## Federal University of Maranh√£o

### Main goal: to develop, without any library (such as OpenCV), the following:

1. Dithering:
  - Simple threshold;
  - Threshold with random modulation;
  - Threshold with ordered periodic cluster modulation;
  - Threshold with dispersed periodic ordered modulation;
  - Threshold with orderly aperiodic modulation;
  
2. Binary Mathematical Morphology:
  - Erosion
  - Dilation
  - Opening
  - Closure
  - Inner edge
  - Outer edge 
  
3. Monochromatic mathematical morphology:
  - Erosion
  - Dilation
  - Opening
  - Closure
  - Smoothing
  - Gradient 
  
  
## TODO

- Interface
- Smoothing
